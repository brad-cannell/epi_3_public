# ⭐️Overview

Calculations for the case-control study . Eventually, this material may be helpful for [R Notes](https://brad-cannell.github.io/r_notes/) and/or [R4Epi](https://www.r4epi.com/).

# 📦Load packages

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

# Odds

```{r}
xtab <- matrix(
  c(a = 50, b = 25, c = 100, d = 100),
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
)

xtab
```

Odds of exposure among cases 

```{r}
odds_cases <- xtab[1, 1] / xtab[2, 1]
odds_cases
```

And we can express the odds in many different ways. For example, as a over c or as a to c. In this particular case, that translates to 50 over 100 or 50 to 100. Or, if we divide 50 by 100 we get 0.5, which we can also express as 0.5 to 1. In other words, for every 0.5 cases who were exposed there was one who wasn't exposed.

If we move the decimal one place to the right on both sides of our ratio, we get 5 to 10, and we can say for every 5 cases who were exposed there were 10 cases who were not exposed.


```{r}
1 / odds_cases
```

We could also divide the odds (0.5) by 1 and put them on the right hand side of the ratio. We could then say for every case who was exposed there were 2 cases who were not exposed. As you can see, we can get the same answer by dividing 100 by 50 and putting the answer on the right hand side of the ratio. 

All of these are equivalent ways of expressing the odds of exposure among cases.

Odds of exposure among controls 

```{r}
odds_controls <- xtab[1, 2] / xtab[2, 2]
odds_controls
```

```{r}
1 / odds_controls
```

1:4. For every control who was exposed there were 4 controls who were not exposed.

Now that we've calculated the odds of exposure among cases and controls, we may want to compare them in order to say something about the association (or lack thereof) between exposure and outcome -- or being a case. 

And remember that an association exists when the distribution of the thing we are measuring is different, on average, in two groups. Alternatively, we can say that Knowing something about x tells us something about y or helps us predict y. 

We can tell just by looking at the odds, which are 0.5 and 0.25, that they aren't the same. That is, the odds of being exposed if you are a case are greater than the odds of being exposed if you are a control. But, how much greater? Well, the ratio of the odds among cases to the odds among controls tells us that...

```{r}
odds_cases / odds_controls
```

the odds of exposure among cases is 2 times the odds of exposure among controls.

# Odds and risk

```{r}
1 - 0.001
```


```{r}
(180 / (180 + 982)) / (30 / (30 + 997))
```


# Simulate data

Sometimes, it’s helpful to start by discussing a cohort study. In the example shown here, severe hypertension and acute myocardial infarction are the exposure and the outcome of interest, respectively. For these data, because the risk of myocardial infarction is relatively low for both the exposed and unexposed groups, the odds of developing the disease approximate the probabilities; as a result, the odds ratio of disease (exposed vs unexposed) approximates the relative risk.

Hypothetical cohort study of the 1-year incidence of acute myocardial infarction in individuals with severe systolic hypertension (≥ 180 mm Hg) and normal systolic blood pressure (< 120 mm Hg).

```{r}
cohort_ct <- matrix(
  c(a = 180, b = 9820, c = 30, d = 9970),
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
)

# Add names to make the matrix more readable
rownames(cohort_ct) <- c("Severe Hypertension", "Normotensive")
colnames(cohort_ct) <- c("MI", "No MI")

cohort_ct
```

```{r}
cohort_ct <- cbind(cohort_ct, rowsum = rowSums(cohort_ct))
cohort_ct <- rbind(cohort_ct, colsum = colSums(cohort_ct))
cohort_ct
```

The risk (incidence proportion) of MI among severe hypertension = 180 / 10,00 = 0.018
The risk (incidence proportion) of MI among normotensive = 30 / 10,000 = 0.003

```{r}
ip <- cohort_ct[, "MI"] / cohort_ct[, "rowsum"]
cohort_ct <- cbind(cohort_ct, ip)
cohort_ct
```

Risk ratio (RR) = 0.018 / 0.003 = 6.0

```{r}
ip_exposed <- cohort_ct["Severe Hypertension", "ip"]
ip_unexposed <- cohort_ct["Normotensive", "ip"]
risk_ratio <- ip_exposed / ip_unexposed
risk_ratio
```

Interpretation: Participants with severe hypertension had 6 times the risk of MI over the 1-year study period compared to participants with normotensive blood pressure.

# Odds ratio 

```{r}
odds_exposed <- cohort_ct["Severe Hypertension", "ip"]
```
