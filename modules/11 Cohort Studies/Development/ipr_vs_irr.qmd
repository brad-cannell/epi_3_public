Curious about the relationship between incidence proportion ratios and incidence rate ratios. 

See Relationship Between Density (Based on Individual Data) and Rate (Based on Grouped Data)

Start with the sample from the lab warm-up

![](../augers_and_injuries_plot.png)

Four out of 12 people were injured. So, the IP is:

```{r}
4 / 12
```

In the example above the IR is:

```{r}
time_at_risk <- (12 * 8) + 7 + 2 + 5 + 10
4 / time_at_risk
```

These are the same.

What if everyone who has an injury has it during the first month of follow-up?
(Subtract 1 because it is zero-based)

```{r}
time_at_risk <- (12 * 8)
4 / time_at_risk
```

What if everyone who has an injury has it during the sixth month of follow-up?
(Subtract 1 because it is zero-based)

```{r}
time_at_risk <- (12 * 8) + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5
4 / time_at_risk
```

What if everyone who has an injury has it during the twelfth month of follow-up?
(Subtract 1 because it is zero-based)

```{r}
time_at_risk <- (12 * 8) + 11 + 11 + 11 + 11
4 / time_at_risk
```

First of all, rate are not proportions. So, even thought the rates "look" kind of like proportions, they aren't. There is something about this in Modern Epidemiology (pg. 61).
