Hi all,

Just a quick update on your lab. I lowered the grade that Libby assigned to you over the weekend. However, you can resubmit to receive full credit if you would like. If you do, please email us and let us know. Canvas will not do so automatically.

	1	The instructions for task for question two were to copy and paste your code. You submitted a screenshot.
	2	Please write your code in such a way that each chunk does a single thing. So, in this case, separate the code that creates the data frame from the code that prints the data frame.
	3	Please follow the coding best practices discussed in R4Epi -- spacing, returns, etc.
	4	Your response to question 3 will not work. Please correct it. 
	5	Naming your code file "1" is not consistent with coding best practices. Please choose a more informative name.

Please just let me know if you have any questions.

Respectfully,
Brad
