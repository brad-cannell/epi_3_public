# Load packages

Remember, it's considered a best practice to load all the packages that your file will use up at the top of the file. If you have not yet installed a package, you will need to do so by running `install.packages("package name")` in the R console. For example, to install the `dplyr` package, you would run `install.packages("dplyr")`. However, you typically **do not** want to type the code to install the package here in your Rmd file. That is because you only need to install the package once on a given computer. Not every time you run your R code.

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE) # The "warn.conflicts" part is optional
library(broom)
library(meantables)
library(freqtables)
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr)
library(tidyr)
```


# Overview

This R Notebook contains a demonstration that is intended to help you develop an intuition for frequentist interpretations of p-values and 95% confidence intervals.


# Example: Class height

In this first example, we will estimate the mean height for a group of students who took my course several years ago. 

```{r}
class_heights <- tibble(
  id = 1:52,
  height = c(
    71, 74, 62, 64, 62, 63, 63, 70, 68, 66, 65, 59, 61, 66, 74, 62, 65, 64, 71, 
    67, 63, 70, 68, 63, 63, 78, 67, 68, 67, 68, 66, 64, 62, 64, 73, 64, 65, 76, 
    67, 64, 59, 66, 71, 73, 65, 64, 66, 67, 65, 62, 48, 66
  ),
  sex = c(
    'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Female', 'Female', 'Female', 'Female', 'Male', 
    'Male', 'Male', 'Female', 'Female', 'Female', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 
    'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Female', 'Male', 'Male', 'Female', 
    'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Female', 
    'Female', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Male', 'Male', 'Female', 
    'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Female', 'Female', 'Female', 
    'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Male'
  )
)
```

Estimating difference in mean height by sex assigned at birth.

```{r}
glm(
  height ~ sex,
  family = gaussian(link = "identity"),
  class_heights
) %>% 
  tidy()
```

* The estimated mean height among females is 64.2.

* On average, males are 4.3 inches taller than females. 

* Null hypothesis: The true difference in height between males and females is zero.

* Test statistic is 3.5

* The probability of finding a p-value of 3.5 or higher if all of the assumptions are correct is 0.001.


# Confidence intervals

Generating 10,000 random participants. About half male and half female.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
n <- 10000
random_data <- tibble(
  sex = sample(c("Female", "Male"), n, T)
)
```

```{r}
random_data %>% 
  freq_table(sex)
```

Assigning heights to the generated participants at random (within certain parameters).

```{r}
set.seed(123)
random_data <- random_data %>% 
  mutate(
    height = if_else(
      sex == "Female",
      rnorm(n, 71.00, 4.32),
      rnorm(n, 64.30, 2.11)
    )
  )
```

```{r}
random_data %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  mean_table(height) %>% 
  select(group_cat, mean, sd, lcl, ucl)
```

Randomly select samples of 100 participants

```{r}
# Demonstrate sample of data
set.seed(123)
sample_n(random_data, 10)
```

```{r}
# Demonstrate multiple samples of data
set.seed(123)
map(1:2, ~ sample_n(random_data, 10))
```

```{r}
set.seed(137)
n_samples <- 100
random_samples <- tibble(
  sample = 1:n_samples,
  data = map(1:n_samples, ~ sample_n(random_data, 10))
)
```

```{r}
# Demonstrate extracting a df from a list column
random_samples$data[[1]]
```

```{r}
# Demonstrate passing an extracted df to the mean_table() function
random_samples$data[[1]] %>% 
  mean_table(height) %>% 
  select(mean, lcl, ucl)
```

Calculate the stats of interest for each of the samples

```{r}
random_samples <- random_samples %>% 
  mutate(
    mean_table = map(data, ~ mean_table(.x, height))
  )
```

```{r}
# Demonstrate extracting a df of results from a list column
random_samples$mean_table[[1]]
```
Unnest the results

```{r}
random_samples %>% 
  unnest(mean_table)
```

Count the number of CI's that do not include the true population mean

```{r}
mean_table(random_data, height)
```

```{r}
summary <- random_samples %>% 
  unnest(mean_table) %>% 
  select(sample, mean, lcl, ucl)
```

```{r}
summary <- summary %>% 
  mutate(contain_pop_mean = lcl <= 67.67 & 67.67 <= ucl)
```

```{r}
summary
```

```{r}
summary %>% 
  freq_table(contain_pop_mean)
```


```{r}
set.seed(123)
n_samples <- 100
random_samples <- tibble(
  sample = 1:n_samples,
  data = map(1:n_samples, ~ sample_n(random_data, 10))
)
```

```{r}
random_samples <- random_samples %>% 
  mutate(
    mean_table = map(data, ~ mean_table(.x, height))
  )
```

```{r}
summary <- random_samples %>% 
  unnest(mean_table) %>% 
  select(sample, mean, lcl, ucl)
```

```{r}
summary <- summary %>% 
  mutate(contain_pop_mean = lcl <= 67.67 & 67.67 <= ucl)
```

```{r}
summary %>% 
  freq_table(contain_pop_mean)
```


# Example: Class height 2

```{r}
glm(
  height ~ sex,
  family = gaussian(link = "identity"),
  class_heights
) %>% 
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE)
```

* The estimated mean height among females is 64.2.

* On average, males are 4.3 inches taller than females. 

* Null hypothesis: The true difference in height between males and females is zero.

* Test statistic is 3.5

* The probability of finding a p-value of 3.5 or higher if all of the assumptions are correct is 0.001.

* The confidence limits indicate that these data are highly compatible with estimates between 1.9 inches and 6.8 inchesâ€” assuming that the statistical model used to construct the limits is correct and that our estimates were free from bias.
